Library

A library kata for my mom

PART 1

I'm some dude.  I want to build a library!  I want some software to help me with the information about the library.  I need it to do these things:

*Keep records of what books we have by title and author
*Keep records of how many of each book we have available
*Keep records of how many of each book we have checked out
*Mark books as checked out by someone
*Show me when books are due
*Mark books as checked back in
*Keep a record of the check outs and check ins of each book

Go.


PART 2

My library thing is going great.  I want the software to do more things:

*I now carry DVD's and magazines at my library in addition to books.  I need to be able to do everything with them that I can do with books.
*I want to determine the due-date of an item by type.  Books are due back in ten days, DVD's are due back in five, and magazines are due back in three.
*For DVD's, I want to store the viewing time.  For books and magazines, I want to know the number of pages.
*I want my library system to know the current date, and I want to be able to tell the library when a day elapses and have it update the current date appropriately
*I want to be able to calculate fines for overdue books.  Books accumulate 5c per day until the fifth day, after which they accumulate 10c per day until the fines equal the book price.  DVD fines are set equal to their purchase price on the first day they're overdue.  Magazine fines increase by 20c per day until equal to the purchase price.

PART 3

Awesome!  My library thing is going great.  I now have six five-star library hotels and a library submarine.  I even have a library restaurant.  Can you add some more things, like:

*I want people to be able to request an item, so that the next available book is held for pickup for them.
*If people request an item and don't pick it up within two days, I want to put the item back in circulation
*If there is nobody requesting an item, I want the person who has that item checked out to be able to renew it up to 4 times, moving the due date forward by one week.
